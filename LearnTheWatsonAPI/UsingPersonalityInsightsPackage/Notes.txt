The 'CelebrityMatch.py' code requires a PersonalityInsights username and
password that is automatically generated from creating a PersonalityInsights
instance. I have removed my credentials for uploading, but to use it requires
it to be reimplemented.

The details to do so can be found in the course on Codecademy.
