# Practice-CodeAcademy
A repository containing practice code from my studies on CodeAcademy for portfolio purposes, therefore this is not a genuine open-source project. 

# Practice-CodeAcademy
As the description states, this repository is a collection of the practice code and projects that I have worked on using CodeAcademy.

All copyrights and content belong to CodeAcademy, I am merely uploading the code that I have written over it. I would like to thank the people of CodeAcademy for the learning experience.

<I plan to rewrite the copyright claims should it not be sufficient for Github uploading. Review the markdown language if necessary.>
