# Practice-CodeAcademy
A repository containing practice code from my studies on CodeAcademy, not a real Open Project. 

# Practice-CodeAcademy
As the description states, this repository is a collection of the practice code and projects that I have worked on using CodeAcademy.

As such, it is not really an open project for the people to contribute to, but its a public record of my accomplishments in which I can reflect upon should the need arise.

All copyrights and content belong to CodeAcademy, I am merely uploading the code that I have written over it. I would like to thank the people of CodeAcademy for the learning experience.

*/I plan to rewrite the copyright claims should it not be sufficient for Github uploading. Review the markdown language if necessary.
